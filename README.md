## üìä Data & Analysis Methods

### 1. **Statistical Analysis of Employee Salaries**
   - **Average Salary**: Using Excel formulas, the average salary of employees is calculated to identify the typical pay across all employees.
   - **Median Salary**: The median salary is calculated to understand the central tendency of salary distribution, especially useful when the salary data is skewed.
   - **Mode Salary**: This metric shows the most frequently occurring salary value among employees.
   - **Max & Min Salary**: The highest and lowest salaries are identified to understand the extremes in the data.
   - **Sum of Salaries**: The total payroll sum is calculated by adding up all employee salaries.

### 2. **Salaries by Department**
   - **Using Formulas**: Excel formulas (e.g., `AVERAGEIFS`, `MAXIFS`, `MINIFS`) are used to calculate the average, maximum, minimum, and sum of salaries per department.
   - **Using Pivot Table**: A Pivot Table is used to dynamically analyze salary data by department, providing a summary of key statistics.
   - **Top 2 Salaries by Department**: Using Excel functions, the top two highest salaries per department are displayed, and an **interactive slicer** is added for easy filtering by department.
   - **Least 2 Salaries by Department**: Similarly, the lowest two salaries per department are identified and displayed.

### 3. **Salaries by Country**
   - **Top 5 Salaries by Country**: A **Pivot Table** is used to display the top 5 highest salaries by country, with a slicer for filtering by country.
   - **Least 2 Salaries by Country**: The lowest two salaries are also calculated and displayed for each country.

### 4. **Bonus & Payout Analysis**
   - **XLOOKUP for Bonus Calculation**: The **XLOOKUP** function is used to retrieve bonus information based on employee ID, department, or other relevant criteria.
   - **Bonus Payout Report**: The report consolidates salary and bonus data to calculate the total compensation for each employee.

### 5. **Employee Report with Bonus Payout**
   - The final employee report is segmented into **Country** and **Department** categories, providing salary, bonus, and total payout details for each employee.
